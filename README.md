qt-ponies
=========

This is an implementation of desktop-ponies (http://www.desktopponies.com/) in Qt.

Inspired by qponies project by svenstaro (https://github.com/svenstaro/qponies).

Compilation
===========
A compiler supporting C++11 is required, as are Qt libraries.

\# qmake  
\# make  
\# ./ponies


Running
=======
Extract DesktopPonies into desktop-ponies directory. Run ./ponies .

Due to case-sensitivity of filenames under Unix, all 'pony.ini' files 
must be renamed to lower case. The case of .gif files in pony.ini must
also be correct.

Other information
=================
This is a work in progress. Files from Desktop ponies not included.
Tested on Linux 3.2, Qt 4.7, g++ 4.6.2.
